I, together with 2 other students majoring in math, took part in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling 2020, and won the Meritorious Winner prize.

In our paper, we mainly made efforts to find and identify key patterns, relationships and measures
in past customer supplied ratings and reviews to help Sunshine Company to gain insight into online
markets and make market decisions. Models we constructed include one based on entropy theorem
and one combining Doc2Vec and T-SNE method. We were able to display text-based information
in a two-dimension scale.
