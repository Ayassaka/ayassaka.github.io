## What is this?

An interactive LaTeX equation editor with **selection syncing**.

That is, you can select source code from the rendered equation, and vice versa.

## How is this done?

This project is based on:

- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) with some [customization](https://github.com/jz-wenxuan/MathJax-src), which tracks TeX source location while compiling.
- [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/), with great syntax highlighting support for LaTeX.
