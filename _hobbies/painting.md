![Smoky Mountains]({{ site.url }}/images/smoky-mountains.JPG)
Somewhere in the Great Smoky Mountain. Had great time there with my family.

![Blue Rose]({{ site.url }}/images/blue-rose.JPG)
I painted this when I was a student in a studio that teach children to paint, with reference to another oil painting of red rose. I really like this simple idea of using some warm color in the backgraound as contrast.

This is a picture of my high school back in Shanghai, using watercolor.

![New Haven]({{ site.url }}/images/new-haven.png)
I also do graphic design digitally. This is from a course project in my university. It is the seaside of New Haven, CT, with a style in response to Lotta Nieminen.
