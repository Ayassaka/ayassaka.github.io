Seven years ago, I was stunned by a harmonica song in a video game, *Trails in the Sky*. That led me into the world of music. Since then, I practiced to play not only classical music, but also pop songs that I like, using various musical instruments.

I've uploaded some of my coverings online. Here is one of my most popular works. More videos can be found [here](https://space.bilibili.com/10808152).
